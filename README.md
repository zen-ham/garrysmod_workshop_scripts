[![ ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open_Source_Week-white?logo=opensourceinitiative)](https://github.com/zen-ham/zen-ham/tree/main#open-source-week) day 2 release!

A few scripts I use for making the process of uploading maps to the steam workshop a bit more streamlined. Just set up the config file and hit run on create_gma.py and upload_addon.py and the map should be all nice and tidy on the workshop.
